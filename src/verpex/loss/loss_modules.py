"""Loss functions for landmark regression.

All losses share the signature ``(pred, target, mask=None, surface=None,
weights=None)`` so they are interchangeable in a config, and so
:class:`CompoundLoss` can combine any of them. ``pred`` and ``target`` are
``(batch, n_landmarks, 3)`` coordinate tensors; ``mask`` is a
``(batch, n_landmarks)`` boolean selecting the landmarks that count; ``weights`` is
an optional ``(batch, n_landmarks)`` tensor giving each landmark a relative weight
in the mean, used by the neighbour-aware module to emphasise the current vertebra
over its neighbours.

Callers pass coordinates already scaled to millimetres, so a loss value means the
same thing regardless of the voxel spacing the sample was acquired at.
